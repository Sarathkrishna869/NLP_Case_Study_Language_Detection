# NLP_Case_Study_Language_Detection
This project focuses on building a model to detect the language of a given text. This involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the data, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms to train and evaluate the model.

The case study likely includes the following components:
-Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathering a dataset with text samples in different languages and cleaning the data to remove noise.
-Feature Extraction: Converting text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning models. This might involve techniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, or character n-grams.
-Model Training: Applying machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, neural networks) to train a language detection model.
-Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
-Optimization and Fine-tuning: Improving the model's performance through hyperparameter tuning and other optimization techniques.
-Results and Analysis: Presenting the findings, visualizing results, and drawing conclusions from the study.
